# Contributing

Grazie per l'interesse nel contribuire! / Thanks for your interest in contributing!

This repository accompanies my [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhfUYHX0iN8&list=PLEdMmYQJeMkSlkSHCGJpUCFKPQ66GF5qx) on PHP architecture and design patterns. The code here reflects specific lessons, so contributions should align with the teaching goals.

---

## ✅ Welcome Contributions

- **Bug fixes** — Broken code, failed tests, incorrect implementations
- **Typos & grammar** — In code comments, READMEs, or documentation
- **Improved explanations** — Clearer comments or documentation that help learners
- **Translation improvements** — Better Italian or English phrasing
- **Suggestions** — Open an Issue to propose new topics or request clarifications

## ❌ Not Accepted

- **Major architectural changes** — The code structure reflects specific video lessons
- **New patterns or episodes** — Content roadmap is tied to the video series
- **Framework/PHP version upgrades** — Must stay compatible with video content
- **Unrelated features** — This is a teaching repo, not a production application

## How to Contribute

**For typos or small fixes:**
Fork → Fix → Open PR

**For anything else:**
Open an Issue first to discuss. This saves everyone time if the change doesn't fit the project's teaching goals.

**Before submitting a PR:**

```bash
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

All tests must pass.
